A Cc Checker by [Reboot13](https://t.me/reboot13)
This checker authenticate/charge depends on what type of site you use
1req= auth & 2req= charge
#note- 1-req is right now not accepting luminati so this checker is working on Ssl proxies
there may be so problem with proxies while 2req works on luminati,webshare,scrape-api etc

You can get CCN and CVV lives both from this checker doesn't mater 1req/2req
(1req need good proxies so every cards can get checked)


Create a file proxy.txt and add Proxies if you are not using zones
